Notes on CSP.

Brought to the mainstream by Go, copied by Core.Async.

"Go Blocks" create the illusion of synchronous flow.

A Go Block always returns a channel

Terminology of operations for write and read is "Put" and "Take"

Semantics of CSP state that if something is written there must be a reader.

If a writer writes without a reader, or a reader reads without a writer, then the Go block is suspending until a such a time that there is a reader or writer (respectively).

This fact is considered fundamentally important. Its how Go works, and is how the original CSP model was defined.

David Nolen says put immutable values on channels to avoid data races which is a problem in Golang.

Since channels are first class you may put channels onto channels.

For instance `fan-in` in core.async (aka merge) accepts many channels and returns one channel. All the given channels are put onto this one channel which help use-cases where you only want to read from a single channel.

CSP is push-and-pull based. Therefore it is possible to create generators wherein a function just streams out values that it itself produces! No IO source, just in-process computation.

This can be used to achieve throttling. For instance an `interval` generator may only supply values after a minimum timeout on each loop. Given the right composition this `interval` channel could be combined with an e.g. `scroll event` channel causing the latter to be throttled by the timing of the former.


Go blocks can be used to create mini private event loops


Errors in Go Blocks have regular error handling via `try catch`. This means that stack traces are good in the sense that the source of the error is at the top of the stack.

CSP has a problem called `deadlock` wherein a reader that inadvertantly reads something that will never have a writer.

Clojure has a standard library around core.async for pub/sub, pause/resume, merge, etc.
