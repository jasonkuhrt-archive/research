title: What is the Maybe Monad?
---


This essay will explore the Maybe Monad.

As the [Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Maybe.html) documentation states:

> The Maybe type encapsulates an optional value. A value of type `Maybe a` either contains a value [...] or it is empty. Using Maybe is a good way to deal with errors or exceptional cases [...].

Examples of "optional values" are:

- Establishing a TCP socket connection. The server may have crashed, the client may have no internet connection, etc.
- Reading the file names in a folder. The folder may have been deleted, unix folder permissions may prohibt non-sudo access, etc.

We can also model basic human ineraction processes such as:

- A confirmation prompt. The OS confirms that the user really wants to empty their garbage, close a window that has unsaved text, etc.

Languages that have `Maybe` available in their standard library include [`Haskell`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.7.0.2/docs/Data-Maybe.html) and `Scala`. Other languages have it available in userland including `JavaScript`.
